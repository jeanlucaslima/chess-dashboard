# chess-dashboard
A chess dashboard based on lichess, run on your local machine

# Why?
Because I want more insights with beautiful charts for my games. 

## Feature ideas

* [ ] Plot by games instead of by date
* [ ] Highlight winning streaks
* [ ] Highligh losing streaks
* [ ] Overlay dates on Elo x #games graph
* [ ] Games by day graph (#games x date)
* [ ] Grab games from lichess API
* [ ] Calendar with gree/red/grey days - each color for rate variation, could have intensity

## Insights ideas

* [ ] Weekly average rating, with how many games
* [ ] Average daily rating, with "shadow" that as large as many games there were

# How to run

TBD
