# chess-dashboard
A chess dashboard based on lichess, run on your local machine

# Why?
Because I want more insights with beautiful charts for my games. 

## Feature ideas

* [ ] Plot by games instead of by date
* [ ] Highlight winning streaks
* [ ] Highligh losing streaks
* [ ] Overlay dates on Elo x #games graph
* [ ] Games by day graph (#games x date)
* [ ] Grab games from lichess API
* [ ] Calendar with gree/red/grey days - each color for rate variation, could have intensity
* [ ] Dataviz: winning/lose streaks as a graph 

## Insights ideas

* [ ] Weekly average rating, with how many games
* [ ] Average daily rating, with "shadow" that as large as many games there were


# Benchmark 

Here I'll list some projects that inspired me to create this one. 

* [Lichess' Chess ground](https://github.com/lichess-org/chessground) a chess UI that lichess uses (GPL3.0)
* [EnCroissant](https://encroissant.org/) an open-source, cross-platform chess GUI that aims to be powerful, customizable and easy to use.

# How to run

TBD
